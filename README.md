RaspberryPiLcdMenu
==================

A menu driven application template for the Adafruit LCD Plates on a
Raspberry Pi.

It provides a simple way to navigate a nested set of menus, and run
various functions, by pressing the buttons on the Adafruit LCD Plate.
Included is a way to determine the IP address of the Pi when running
headless.  Also, allows the user to select from a large list of choices
(using List Selector), by cycling through letters vertically and
horizontally.
It uses an XML file to configure the menu structure, and processes tags
to enable different options.  XML element support includes:
- folders, for organizing menus.
- widgets, which are really just functions to call in the code.
- run, which allows you to run any command and see the output on the LCD.

It assumes the user has the LCD Plate from Adafruit already attached.
It is also possible to make a quick modification to the LCD libraries to
detect if the LCD is attached before progressing into the app.  Though
with their new updates, not sure how to do that now.  Support is
included also to turn on the LCD to different colors. (at least for
the 16x2 positive LCD plate)
You can also launch the Python based application from /etc/init.d using
the provided init file.  In that mode, you can launch right into the
application without keyboard or monitor, yet still determine the IP
address, change networks if you like, or any other capability you build
in.  Obviously double check the content of the provided init file before
use.  Also note that once you put it in init.d, if you don't actually
connect the LCD, you may find lots of error messages.  You may want to
test for presence of the LCD before running it.
Included also is an approach to switch networks from the UI, in case you
want to switch between different network layouts if you travel with it.

Some of the canned menu items are functional, but other are place
holders to spawn ideas.  Such as using gphoto2 to trigger DSLR camera
operations, or using raspistill to capture images from the Pi Camera.
Or using the ephem library to do astronomy calculations.  Or connecting
the Pi to your GPS to auto locate.

To get started, put all these files somewhere.  Then obtain the Adafruit
LCD python code.  From that, copy the files from:
Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code/Adafruit_CharLCDPlate/
into the same folder as this code.

Then you should be able to do:
python lcdmenu.py

Enjoy!
